This is an example script based on my attempts to generate WebGL from running GL code.
It is designed as a recorder, so there is additional complexity as the commands cannot receive the return values from the remote

Requirements:

Scala v11

To generate gl.c

scalac gen.scala && cat glapis.h | scala functionParser > gl.c
